# DISK-SCHEDULING-ALGORIHTMS
Welcome to the Disk Scheduling Algorithms repository! Here, you'll find implementations of three disk scheduling algorithms: C-Look, LIFO, and Look. These algorithms are vital in optimizing disk access and improving system performance. Each algorithm comes with clear implementations and documentation to help you understand their functionalities and trade-offs.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different inputs, and contribute to enhancing these implementations. Your contributions are valuable in advancing the understanding and practical application of disk scheduling algorithms.

Happy coding!
